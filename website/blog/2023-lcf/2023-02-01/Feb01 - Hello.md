## Why Low Code?

As the market for low-code platform continues to flourish (with projected growth this year of nearly 20% over 2022), now is the time to explore what it can mean for you. 

[**Low-code development**](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/what-is-low-code/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) are becoming more popular as businesses look for ways to modernize their IT infrastructure and generate more output in less time. 

Developers can focus on the creative aspects of app building while still taking advantage of powerful cloud computing technologies such as scalability, security, and reliability.

Starting today, we invite you to spend a month getting the low-down on low-code development with an exciting series of tutorials, workshops, and interactive resources during [**#LowCodeFebruary**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february).

## Start low coding with Microsoft

With [**Microsoft Power Apps**](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) you can quickly build custom apps with drag-and-drop tools and pre-built templates, making it easier to create powerful apps that are tailored for your needs.  Low-code development with Azure helps businesses accelerate their innovation cycle and make the most out of their data resources. 

Low-code app development through Microsoft Power Platform and Azure can be used to automate workflows, reduce manual efforts, and speed up the development process for building line-of-business apps at a lower cost.

According to [**Forrester**](https://aka.ms/2022ForresterTEI), composite organizations experience benefits of **140% ROI** and **45% cost reduction** in app development when using Power Platform premium capabilities. The majority of users say Power Platform‚Äôs premium capabilities increase revenue and offers faster solution quoting through better data integration. 

In other words, with Power Platform you‚Äôll produce more and better code than before, with increased cost savings. That means developing more projects and delivering increased value to your clients. With low code, everyone wins!
